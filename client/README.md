Simple Awesome Notepad App

As the name suggests, this application is for creating, updating and viewing notes. A note comprises of 5 parameters:

_id → UUID generated by the server during event creation (String)
name → Name of the event (String)
Title → Name of the note
content → content of the note
lastModified → The recent time the note was edited

The application is split into two components: Backend server API and Frontend visualizing application. Backend server is written in Typescript using Node JS Express framework. And the frontend app is based on React JS. For the data storage, MongoDB Atlas cloud based NoSQL database is used.

I chose React JS for the frontend application because I have been working on React and I am quite comfortable with it.
