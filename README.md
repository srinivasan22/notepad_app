A Simple Notepad App 

As the name suggests, this application is for creating, updating and viewing notes. An event comprises of 4 parameters:

_id → UUID generated by the server during event creation (String)
title → Name of the note (String)
content → content of the note
lastModified → The last edited time of the note 


The application is split into two components: Backend server API and Frontend visualizing application. Backend server is written in Typescript using Node JS Express framework. And the frontend app is based on React JS. For the data storage, MongoDB Atlas cloud based NoSQL database is used.

I chose React JS for the frontend application because I have been working with React in the recent months and I am quite comfortable with this.
